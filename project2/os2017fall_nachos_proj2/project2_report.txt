				FCFS	SJF	NP_P	P
1) Average waiting time		18.6	12.2	12.2	16.4
2) Average response time	18.6	12.2	12.2	7.2
3) Average turn-around time	32.6	26.2	26.2	30.4


2.
Difference: SJF has shorter time than FCFS in all three aspects.

In FCFS and SJF, Average waiting time and Average response time always are the
same. The difference between Average waiting time and Average turn-around time 
is Average running time, which is independent with scheduling algorithm. 
Hence, we only need consider Average waiting time.

SJF: 
Pro: Have short Average waiting time.
Cons: SJF takes at least O(logn) time complexity(binary search) or O(n) time(scanning) 
to do the insertion and have the problem of starvation.

FCFS:
Pros: Easy to implement and take constant time to do the queing.
cons: Have long Average waiting time.


3.
Difference: NP_P has shorter Average waiting time and longer Average response
time than P.

The difference between Average waiting time and Average turn-around time
is Average running time, which is independent with scheduling algorithm.
Hence, we only need consider Average waiting time and Average response time.

NP_P  
Pro: Have short Average waiting time
cons: Have long Average response time and have the problem of starvation.

P
Pro: Have short Average response time, which is useful for dealing with emergency tasks 
and should be good at processing responsive programs.
cons: Have long Average waiting time and have the problem of starvation more serious.

The reason is P may be preemptive low Priority process, which lets low Priority 
process wait indefinitely. This will make longer Average waiting time.
On the other hand, P can be preemptive, so it can let high Priority process
to execute immediately. This will make shorter Average response time.
